					<p>Cruelty to animals, also called animal abuse or animal neglect, is the intentional infliction by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal, regardless of whether the act is against the law. More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific gain, such as killing animals for food or for their fur; opinions differ about the extent of cruelty associated with a given method of slaughter. Cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering for personal amusement, as in zoosadism.Animal abuse is bad. Innocent animals get harmed in unimaginable ways in which they do not deserve to be treated.</p>
					<p>
					Laws concerning animal cruelty are designed to prevent needless cruelty. "Millions of animals, mostly frogs, are killed every year expressly for educational use. This action leaves the impression that animal lives can be wasted if this benefits humanity."[1] Divergent approaches to such laws occur in different jurisdictions throughout the world. For example, some laws govern methods of killing animals for food, clothing, or other products, and other laws concern the keeping of animals for entertainment, education, research, or pets. Cruelty to animals is not the same thing as disrespect towards animals.

					In broad terms, there are three conceptual approaches to the 	issue of cruelty to animals. The animal welfare position holds that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for human purposes, such as food, clothing, entertainment, and research, but that it should be done in a way that minimizes unnecessary pain and suffering, sometimes referred to as "humane" treatment.
					</p>
					<p>

					Utilitarian advocates argue from the position of costs and benefits and vary in their conclusions as to the allowable treatment of animals. Some utilitarians argue for a weaker approach which is closer to the animal welfare position, whereas others argue for a position that is similar to animal rights. Animal rights theorists criticize these positions, arguing that the words "unnecessary" and "humane" are subject to widely differing interpretations, and that animals have basic rights. They say that the only way to ensure protection for animals is to end their status as property and to ensure that they are never used as commodities.

					Dogs are man's best friend. And the Best Friends Animal Society wants to keep it that way. The Kanab, Utah-based organization was founded in 1984 with the purpose of providing safe and loving homes for dogs and cats; its mission today is still "no more homeless pets." But the other crucial part of Best Friends' work has been its no-kill mission. At the time of the organization's founding, 17 million animals were being killed in shelters every year, despite the fact that 90 percent of them were adoptable or would’ve been adopted with the right health and behavioral treatment. Thanks to the work of Best Friends, that number today is 4 million. Other campaigns include stopping puppy mills, saving cats, and ending breed discrimination. All of Best Friends' operations are conducted with the following guiding principles in mind: the Golden Rule, kindness, positive influence, leadership, authenticity, and transparency.

					The Denver-based organization, founded in 1910, was named after the British animal shelter Our Dumb Friends League. "Dumb" was used to describe animals back in the day because they don't speak a human language; today, that concept is present in the league's mission statement of "speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves." Twenty-five thousand lost and abandoned animals every year are "spoken for" by the Dumb Friends League through sheltering and care, along with the following services: pairing homeless pets with new owners, reuniting lost pets with their owners, reviewing cases of animal cruelty, backing animal-friendly legislation, teaching animal behavior assistance classes, listing pet-friendly housing in Colorado, providing education on humane animal treatment, and giving donor-financed spaying and neutering to pets in underserved communities.

					"Go big or go home," as the old saying goes. The Humane Society of the United States chose the former, working in all 50 states and earning the title of "the nation’s largest and most effective animal protection organization." The society, founded in 1954 and headquartered in Washington, D.C., conducts itself in two main areas: celebrating animals and confronting cruelty. These translate into supporting animal protection legislation, operating campaigns to bring about reforms, performing animal rescue and emergency response, inspecting cases of animal cruelty, providing animal care at sanctuaries, rehabilitation centers, emergency shelters, and clinics. One of the society's current campaigns is opposing an amendment to the farm bill in Congress by Rep. Steve King (R) of Iowa that would weaken animal welfare laws. Wayne Pacelle, the society's president and CEO, describes the amendment as "a sort of legislative kudzu, so invasive and dangerous."
